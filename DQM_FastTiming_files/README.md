# Fast Timing Service 

The timing results are converted from a root file to a csv. This is done with uproot. I had issues with installing uproot, so there are two files, one for Python 2 and one for Python 3 to run in google colab to avoid install issues. The method is also slow since it reads all zeros in histogram, must be a better way.
